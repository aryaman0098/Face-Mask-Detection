This is a simple face mask detecting project that detects whether the subject is wearing a face mask or not. It makes use of a Convolutional Neural Network Architecture to classify the above case. The live feed is given via the webcam, which is controlled by OpenCV. This model has given a accuracy of 95% on the test data set. Sample output can be seen in the sample output folder. To run this project, you need to have keras, sklearn, OpenCV and seaborn installed in the system. To run the code, run the command "python checker2.py".
